\section{Conclusion}

As of Flink version 0.8, a satisfactory solution for implementing the Lanczos
algorithm doesn't seem to exist yet. The idiomatic approach using delta
iterations and the loop-based approach are either not possible or not feasible.
Using Mahout's implementation of the algorithm would mean taking an
implementation intended to be used specifically with the MapReduce computing
model and squeezing it into the Flink system. While this approach would
probably be possible, we feel that it can't be the 'right' way to do it as it
would undermine many of Flink's individual advantages. Additionally we don't
expect the workaround of materializing all intermediate data to perform
significantly better than Mahout running on Hadoop. This project also
illustrates the current limitations of Apache Flink for implementing iterative
algorithms. In order to develop an idiomatic, satisfactory implementation of
the Lanczos algorithm, one currently has to wait for newer Flink versions that
will support nested iterations.
