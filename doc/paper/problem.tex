\section{Problem Statement}

The goal of our work is to build a program that computes the rank$_k$ approximation of an arbitrary matrix. In the first step, we want to create a program with Apache Flink that runs the Lanczos algorithm in a scalable way for large matrices. After that the intermediate results are passed to an existing solver for eigendecomposition of the Apache Mahout library.

We do not aim to analyze a specific dataset or to draw any domain specific conclusions. We rather want to create a generic tool.
