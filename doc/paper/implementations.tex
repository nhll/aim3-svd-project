\section{Implementations}

% Don't draw any conclusions!
% - E.g. stop after saying that the "nested iterations" exception came up!
% - Conclusions belong to the Results/Conclusion sections

This section discusses our attempts at implementing the different approaches
described in section \ref{sec:approaches}. While we won't go over every single
line of our code, we will still give detailed insight into our implementations
in this section.
